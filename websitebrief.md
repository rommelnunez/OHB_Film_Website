# Website Brief: Our Hero, Balthazar

## Draft 1 - January 7, 2026

## OVERVIEW

The website serves as the official, polished destination for _Our Hero, Balthazar_ and plays a
critical role in **conversion, not discovery**. It should assume interest already exists and focus on
guiding users efficiently from curiosity to action.
While the social campaign is where experimentation, character POVs, provocation, and cultural
play live, the site anchors the campaign with clarity and credibility, drawing from established
marketing materials. It should feel like a seamless transition from social and digital content to
the site, trailer, ticketing, and ultimately the theater.
The site should:
● **Encourage trailer viewing** as the primary engagement action
● **Make it easy to find playdate theaters, opening dates, and showtimes** , and to
**purchase tickets**
● **Act as a trusted reference point** for partners, press, and audiences
● **Function as a conversion engine** , guiding users from trailer viewing to showtimes and
ticketing through intuitive UX and clear credibility signals
● **Enable measurement and learnings** , ensuring traffic, engagement, and conversions
can be tracked and leveraged for retargeting and ongoing optimization, while
maintaining basic organic discoverability
**In short:** Social is where we play. The site is where we convert.

## PRIMARY GOAL

### Drive users to:

1. Watch the trailer
2. Click through to ticketing


3. Attend in-theater Q&As and other IRL events (the site may promote these, but will not
    need to support RSVPs)
**How conversion happens**
● Clear hierarchy and scannability
● Fast load times and mobile-first design
● Immediate access to trailer and ticketing
● Credibility signals (reviews, festival inclusions, talent)

### Secondary goals:

```
● In addition to a great design, utilize the marquee cast, and any good reviews or articles
to increase consumer interest
● Serve as a trusted destination linked across social, paid, and PR
```
## TARGET AUDIENCE

_Pulled directly from the campaign brief, simplified for web:_
● **Primary:** Online-native, culturally engaged audiences discovering the film via social,
press, and conversation
● **Secondary:** Cinephiles, critics, and culturally curious adults seeking validation before
buying a ticket
The site should reward curiosity **quickly and confidently** , without asking users to dig.

## TONE / MOOD

Tone should reinforce credibility and seriousness, even while supporting a bold, edgy campaign
elsewhere. The site should be:
● Polished
● Confident
● Darkly funny, without jokes
● Provocative but responsible
● Prestige-leaning, contemporary, intentional


## FUNCTIONALITY NOTES

```
● Single-page / single-scroll experience
○ Dynamic header with jump links to sections

○ Optimized for social and paid traffic
● Fast, lightweight build
○ Speed = credibility

#### TO COME FROM PRESS KIT

### PRESS & KEY INFLUENCER QUOTES (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Reviews and/or quotes** function as a **conversion signal** , not decoration.
● Prominently featured
● Curated for impact and tone
● Clear outlet attribution
**Existing Quotes to use for placeholder only (they need to be shortened and approved)**
● “Buddy movie for our time. It’s a cutting, audacious, and at times astonishing movie.” –
VARIETY
● “Eleanor is played by Pippa Knowles with a playful, caustic vibrance that seizes the
screen.” – VARIETY
● “An effectively zeitgeist-tapping comedy. Alternately disturbing and brutally funny, and
ending with the sort of capper that perfectly encapsulates its provocative ethos, this
marks an auspicious directorial debut for Oscar Boyson” – THE HOLLYWOOD
REPORTER
● “The stylized filmmaking becomes its own sort of critical point of view here, revving up
the audience and probably encouraging even a few in the room to endorse its agonized
worldview via the movie’s compelling craft.“ – INDIEWIRE
● “ the contradictions in the thrilling pleasures of this film’s craft alongside its darkly comic
warning letter about gun culture make for a potent if ultimately ambivalent first venture.”

## DIGITAL BRANDING & DISTRIBUTION ELEMENTS


### MUST HAVE ELEMENTS

```
● Social Share / Social Preview Optimization
○ Intentional Open Graph setup (image, title, description) so shared links display
cleanly and on-brand across major platforms. Previews should be easily
updatable by campaign phase.
● Favicon & Browser Identity
○ Custom favicon and browser icons that are simple, high-contrast, and legible at
small sizes.
● SEO Basics
○ Clean, foundational SEO (page title, meta description, clear hierarchy) to support
discoverability, credibility, and paid traffic performance.
● Link Sharing & Tracking Readiness
○ Support for UTMs and tracked links without breaking previews; consistent
canonical URLs.
● Browser & Device Consistency
○ Mobile-first, responsive build with consistent rendering across modern browsers;
no default system fonts or placeholders.
● Accessibility & Readability Basics
○ Baseline accessibility (contrast, font sizing, alt text, logical reading order) to
support usability and trust.
● Performance & Load Behavior
○ Fast load times, optimized assets, and no unnecessary scripts or heavy
animation.

### OPTIONAL / PHASE-IN ELEMENTS

```
